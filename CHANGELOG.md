## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- WebUI shows a "Connection Lost" panel with live downtime, retry countdown, and a manual retry button when the daemon is unreachable.
- Sidebar now shows a live connection status indicator; clicking it when offline triggers an immediate reconnect attempt.

### Fixed

- Port conflict on daemon startup now shows a clear error identifying what is blocking the port, instead of silently timing out.
- Daemon startup failures now always print the log tail, regardless of how the process failed.
- Daemon process exit during startup is now distinguished from a runtime exit in error messages.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Initial public release of RunWisp — open-source cron replacement and process supervisor.
- Single binary daemon with embedded SQLite, REST API, and SSE log streaming.
- Embedded Svelte 5 web dashboard served directly by the daemon.
- CLI commands: `run`, `trigger`, `status`, `list`, `add`, `edit`, `validate`, `tui`, `daemon`, `cloud`, `openapi`.
- Bubbletea terminal UI (`tui` command) with home view, exec list, log pane, and dialogs.
- Task scheduler with concurrency, restart, missed-run, and retention policies.
- CHAP authentication for the HTTP API.
- Deterministic human-readable instance fingerprint based on machine-id and working directory.
